Sporting News scripts

## before

If the machine to be provisioned is not a new machine, make sure IT wipes it
before setting it up again for the new user.  Things will not work as expected
if this is not done.

## install

Running the `install` script in this repository will install some tools needed
by Sporting News developers.  Further setup and customization will certainly be
needed but is out of scope for this repo (for now) and generally left up the
the individual developer.

You can run `install` before git or anything else is on the machine like so:

```sh
curl -sSL https://git.io/2nPUsQ |bash
```

## after
